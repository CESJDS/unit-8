# Working with Numbers
Using object oriented programming in order to learn about numbers in computer science. This includes Hex, Octa, Binary, and decimal. We learned how to convert to each one of these manually without the use of a built in function and built a Number class to do so. 
## Requirements
[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and a compatible [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is required to run the files
## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:yoavami/unit-8.git

cd unit-8
```
## Usage
you can mess around with the functions and files in order to understand how to Number class works. 
## Plagarism
This repository is not meant for you to directly or partly copy my work. It is meant to help you undertand any part which you do not and for me to help you with your own program.
